# FDP_dynaseq_demo

Use DynaSeq tool to generate shape profiles of  summit aligned TF binding sites and visualize them.
Also predict specific DNA shape parameters which distinctively classify the profiles, based on average shape and shape ensemble.

Order to run the scripts:
dynaseq_cmd.R
visualize.R
shape_models.R
